# just used to test that the Black formatter git hook works as expected.
# This is not part of the main source code of the project.

# Before formatting:
# a=1
# b = [1, 2, 3,
#      4, 5
#      ]

# if a==0: print('a is 0')
# else: print('a is 1')


a = 1
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

if a == 0:
    print("a is 0")
else:
    print("a is 1")
